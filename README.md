#  Onion Index  (Educational Use Only)

This repository contains a **curated list of .onion URLs** (Tor hidden services) strictly for **educational, academic, and cybersecurity research purposes**.
#### It represents roughly **20% of a broader compilation effort**, selected and reviewed during a **multi-week investigation** into the structure and visibility of accessible hidden services on the Tor network.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**  
I take **no responsibility** for the content hosted on the external .onion domains listed. These links are **publicly available** and were gathered from multiple open sources (e.g. dark web search engines, public directories).
###I do not control, endorse, or encourage the use of any site linked herein.

#### This list has been **heavily filtered** to exclude illegal content, marketplaces, or anything that would violate GitHub’s Terms of Service or basic ethical standards. I’m **paranoid** enough to say that again: if you're expecting anything shady or questionable—**you’re in the wrong repo**.

🔐 **Why So Paranoid?**  
Because getting banned for sharing an academic resource is a terrible way to end a research project.  
Because GitHub doesn't like links to black markets.  
Because context matters, and this context is **documentation, indexing, and visibility**.

If you are here maybe i showed you this repo and i can share more with you :)

🧭 **What’s Inside?**  
- Search engines and indexers (.onion)
- Privacy-focused services
- Anonymous mail & file tools
- Clean directories and navigation resources

🧪 **Purpose**
